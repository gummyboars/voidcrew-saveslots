# Void Crew Save Slots
This mod provides multiple save slots and allows you to choose which one to restore.

Each session is automatically saved into its own slot. When choosing to restore a session, you will see a drop-down menu in-game allowing you to choose a session.

Sessions are stored in the same cloud storage as vanilla saved sessions.
